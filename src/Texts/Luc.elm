    [ "Artistic practice has a conceptual and an aesthetic dimension. Their irreconcilability is a prerequisite.                                                                                                                     Aesthetic thought demonstrates that thought is not tied to language, but that there are unconscious, bodily, felt, material, and practiced forms of thought. Aesthetic thought does not reflect its object at a distance but it is a speculative action that transforms and interacts with material.                                                                                                                                                                                                         There is no method. This is not because artistic practice is based on turmoil, inspiration or whim, but because no abstract scheme of operation can be subtracted from its material entanglement."
