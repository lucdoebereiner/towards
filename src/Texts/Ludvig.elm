Artistic research encompassesa subset of artistic          activities.                                                                                                                                                                         Artistic research does not    require aesthetic adaptation,but certain aesthetic         approaches are more compatiblewith the superficial traits   of traditional modes of       research.                                                                                                                                                                           The idea of artistic researchis a child of its time, it    could not have existed 50     years ago, and it might not   exist 50 years from now.    "
