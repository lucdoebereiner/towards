    [ "Artistic research is a radical form of aesthetic practice. It critically engages with the roots of the artistâ€™s doing and thinking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Artistic research does not rival any other form of       research but will use whateverexisting research paradigms   adapted or adaptable to the   aesthetic practice at hand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Artistic research critically  engages with research paradigms, which is its contribution to the general discourse and conceptual develop-development of research."
