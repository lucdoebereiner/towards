   [ "                                                                                     Artistic research is in its essence a collective and collaborative endeavour.                                                             Artistic research is situated, particular and subjective. It is neither valid nor objective.                                                                                                                                   Artistic research does not produce nor transport knowledge.                                                                                                                                                       Artistic research stages the conditions for aesthetic thinking.                                                                                                                                                                                               Formal and material practices are interwoven to each other, nevertheless maintainingha an incompressible difference. This difference is where the generative potential for aesthetic research lies. Artistic research explores and exposes this gap.   "
   , "The method becomes the object.          The object becomes the method.                                                                                                                                  Method and object do not become the same, they maintain a safe distance.                                                Object and method oscillate, exchange positions, function, texture and materiality.                                                                                                                     Method and object cannot be though of as in other sciences: the one does not simply apply to the other.                                                         Object and method have a complex and mutual retro-action.                                                                                                       Method and object exchange positions: this movement gives the main rhythm articulating artistic research.                                                                                          There                                   is no                               knowledge                             production."
