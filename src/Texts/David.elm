Artistic research is situated,particular and subjective. It is neither valid nor          objective.                                                                                                              Artistic research does not    produce nor transport         knowledge.                                                                                                                                            Artistic research             stages the conditions for     aesthetic thinking.                                                                                                                                                                                               Formal and material practices are interwoven to each other, nevertheless maintain an      incompressible difference.    This difference is where the  generative potential for      aesthetic research lies.      Artistic research explores andexposes this gap.   "
