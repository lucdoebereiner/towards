Artistic research is a radical
form of aesthetic practice. It

roots of the artistâ€™s doing
and thinking.









Artistic research does not
rival any other form of
research but will use whatever
existing research paradigms
adapted or adaptable to the
aesthetic practice at hand.

engages with research para-
digms, which is its contri-
bution to the general dis-
course and conceptual develop-
