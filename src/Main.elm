    "Artistic research is a radical form of aesthetic practice.

Artistic research does not rival any other form of       research but will use whateverexisting research paradigms   adapted or adaptable to the   aesthetic practice at hand.

Aesthetic thought demonstrates that thought is not tied to language, but that there are unconscious, bodily, felt, material, and practiced forms of thought. Aesthetic thought does not reflect its object at a distance but it is a speculative action that transforms and interacts with material.
