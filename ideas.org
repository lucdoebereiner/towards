- [ ] [LD] Display text field borders and editors (elm) 
- [X] [DP] Mute for audio channels (js -> elm) 
  added /sendMute(index, monoff)/ method to the BufferLoader class.
  - /index/ is an integer in the range 0-3 (0 = david, 1 = gerhard, 2 =
    luc, 3 = ludvig)
  - /monoff/ is boolean: true means that channel index will now be muted.

- lagging of pan (with constant lag time for the moment)
* TODO [#B] [LD] Performance of page turning
* TODO [#C] [DP] Security Issues with SharedArrayBuffer
* TODO [#C] [ALL] Think about the rotation parameter/interaction 
* TODO [#C] [ALL] Averaging pages system
- Pages dynamically change to converge to one average page number
- OR the opposite: maximize differences
* TODO [#C] [GE] Understand Depth to speed of change correlation
- experiment with "config.transitionDepth" in Main.elm
- put "config.transitionDepth" in the URL
- Calculate speed
* TODO [#C] [LD] Set up font loading


* Notes
** Tagging 
- Tagging separately audio and text iterations
- Whenever each of us pushes with a message e.g. "DP: iteration done"
  he is signaling he is done. The last pushing his iteration also tags
  the iteration.
- Use tagging also in the audio files repo: do not use links or
  dates. Simplify
