                   where I live, the air
                      does not move much
                                        
we hardly ever get any wind             
                                        
                 every day I take a walk
              up the hill and down again
                                        
on a narrow and winding road            
                                        
            there is very little traffic
                                        
in an hour I may encounter only a       
handfull of cars                        
                                        
                I started with the walks
             to reduce my blood pressure
                                        
the intense breathing hightens          
my the sense of smell                   
                                        
   besides stimulating my cardiovascular
  system I am also training my olfaction
                                        
now, in winter, the smellscape is       
dominated by smoke from domestic heating
                                        
        when fumes are not blown away by
        the wind, they linger on forever
                                        
the foreground scent is shaped by       
smell trails from car exhaust           
                                        
                the background is formed
      by burned gas, oil, coal, and wood
                                        
under ideal conditions, I can sniff them
                  for hundreds of meters
                                        
most of the smells are unpleasant and   
most probably doxic                     
                                        
   we can assume that the people leaving
        those traces are unaware of them
                                        
yet, they are causing them              
                                        
      this irritates me, again and again
                                        
but then, the my irritations get        
supplanted by curiosity                 
                                        
      maybe I have developed hyperosmia,
          became hypersensitive to smell
                                        
there is variety in the stink           
                                        
                   the nose gets to know
                                        
diesel engines are easy to single out   
                                        
    dusty, smokey, imposing, dry, bitter
                                        
a moped has a very complex and nostalgic
smell like from olden times             
                                        
  the chlorine aroma catalytic converter
            is one of the most agressive
                                        
the smell trails linked to the road cut 
through smell islands of domestic fumes 
                                        
 temperature inversion and calm make for
                 a persisting smellscape
                                        
this is a prerequiste for studying it   
                                        
such a kind-of frozen smellscape is rare
   in view of the ephemerality of scents
